- Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
- Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention records.
- Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their red-flag or intervention records.
- Admin can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).
- Users can add images to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
- Users can add videos to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
- The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or intervention location.
- The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
